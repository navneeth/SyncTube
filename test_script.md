Early morning in the Pacific Ocean, and the waves sparkle like golden treasure.

**[SFX: LOUD WHALE SPOUT - "PSSHHHH!"]**

**[HARMONY'S SPOUT APPEARS - MID SHOT of misty water spout rising]**

A big, misty spout bursts into the air—
That's Harmony, a young humpback whale, saying "good morning!"

**[TRACKING SHOT of Harmony swimming beside larger whale]**

**HARMONY:** (VO)  
Mom, why does my spout look like a sparkly cloud?

**MELODY:** (VO)  
That's your warm breath meeting the cool ocean air. Every whale's spout is unique—just like you!

**[CLOSE UP on barnacles on Melody's back]**

**NARRATOR:** (WHISPER)  
See those little bumps on Melody's back? Those are barnacles—tiny creatures that hitch a ride and sparkle like ocean jewels.

## SCENE 2: THE DEEP DIVE

**[HARMONY SURFACING - takes deep breath]**

**MELODY:** (VO)  
Time to hunt!

**NARRATOR:**  
Harmony fills her lungs and dives deep—humpbacks can hold their breath for 20 minutes!

**[UNDERWATER SHOT of Harmony's tail flukes shimmering as she dives]**

**NARRATOR:**  
Her powerful tail—called a fluke—pushes her downward. No two whales' tails are alike!

**[TRACKING SHOT of younger whale doing underwater flips]**

**NARRATOR:** (EXCITED)  
Look—there's her brother Bubbles, doing flips! He's only 10, but humpbacks can live to be 80... even 100!

**[WIDE SHOT of massive cloud of krill with Harmony approaching]**

**NARRATOR:**  
Harmony spots lunch: krill! Tiny shrimp-like creatures.

**[CLOSE UP of Harmony's mouth opening wide]**

**NARRATOR:**  
She opens her giant mouth, gulps water, and strains it through baleen plates—like a giant comb that catches krill.

## SCENE 3: THE SONG OF THE SEA

**[SUNSET OVER OCEAN - pod of whales gathering]**

**NARRATOR:**  
As the sky turns pink, the pod gathers. It's singing time!

**[SFX: HAUNTING WHALE SONG begins softly, builds]**

**NARRATOR:**  
Humpbacks sing songs made of moans and whoops that travel for miles underwater.

**HARMONY:** (VO)  
Why do we sing?

**MELODY:** (VO)  
It's how we share stories and find each other.

**[TRACKING SHOT of elderly whale joining the pod]**

**NARRATOR:**  
Even great-grandma Star joins in—her 70-year-old voice full of wisdom!

## SCENE 4: THE PLAYFUL BREACH

**[SURFACE SHOT - BUBBLES BREACHING with massive splash]**

**[SFX: HUGE SPLASH]**

**NARRATOR:**  
Splash! That's Bubbles breaching—leaping out of the water!
Whales do this to play, talk, or shake off barnacles.

**[UNDERWATER SHOT of Harmony diving deep]**

**BUBBLES:** (VO)  
Your turn!

**NARRATOR:**  
Harmony dives...

**[SLOW-MOTION SHOT of Harmony bursting from water, twisting]**

You're growing fast. I remember my first breach, just like yours.

As night falls, Melody shares big news:

**MELODY:** (VO)  
Tomorrow, we begin our migration!

**NARRATOR:** (GENTLE)  
Every year, humpbacks swim thousands of miles to warmer waters.
And this year, Harmony is ready.

**[WIDE SHOT of Harmony looking up at stars]**

**STAR:** (VO)  
Your blowholes will breathe, your flukes will carry you, and we'll be together.

**[TRACKING SHOT follows Harmony taking a breath, spout glowing in moonlight]**

Harmony takes one last breath, her spout glowing in the moonlight—
Then dives into the dark, starry sea...
